# QBall Dynamics and Control Analysis (MATLAB)

## Overview

This project focuses on modeling and analyzing the dynamics of a QBall aerial platform in MATLAB.

The QBall is a 6-degree-of-freedom (6-DOF) aerial system controlled by four motors with counter-rotating propellers. This project explores the mathematical modeling, control structure, and system behavior of the platform.



## System Description

The QBall platform consists of:

- Four motors with counter-rotating propellers
- 6 degrees of freedom (x, y, z, roll, pitch, yaw)
- Multi-variable control input structure

The objective was to analyze and simulate system behavior under various conditions using MATLAB-based modeling techniques.



## Objectives

- Model QBall dynamics using mathematical system representations
- Analyze 6-DOF motion behavior
- Implement and test control strategies in MATLAB
- Evaluate system response and stability characteristics
- Interpret results using structured simulation output



## Control & Modeling Approach

The system was implemented in MATLAB using structured script-based modeling.

Key elements included:

- Multi-variable system dynamics representation
- State variable formulation
- Control response evaluation
- System output visualization

The full implementation is contained within the primary MATLAB script.
